# ❄️ Snowflake Click Effect ❄️

This project includes a fun feature that creates snowflakes on a click event:



- **🖱️ Event Listener**: The script listens for click events on the document.
- **❄️ Create Snowflake**: When a click is detected, a `span` element is created to act as a snowflake.
- **📍 Style Position**: The snowflake is positioned at the mouse's X and Y coordinates at the time of the click.
- **🎲📏 Random Size**: Each snowflake is given a random size between 20px and 100px to add variety.
- **🧩 Append to Body**: The snowflake is then added to the document body.
- **⏰✨ Fade Away**: The snowflake automatically disappears after 2 seconds for a dynamic effect.
